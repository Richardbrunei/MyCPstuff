# Problem 3. 2D Conveyor Belt
This problem seems difficult at first. However we can start by thinking of a smaller problem. Given a configuration of conveyor belts, how many unusable cells are there? We can try to work backwards. We start in the outside and try to get in. To do this, we can make a graph of what cell leads into each conveyor. For the full problem we do the whole thing backwards and take it offline. We start with the finished conveyor and calculate the amount of unusable cells. Then we start removing conveyors. When we remove conveyors, we check is any of its surrounding cells are usable. If true, then we can DFS our graph to find out what other cells are usable. If all the surrounding cells are unusable, then we set that cell to be empty.
