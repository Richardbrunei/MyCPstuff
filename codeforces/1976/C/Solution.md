# C. Job Interview

Let the first person who did not get the job they wanted be $last$. If the person removed came before $last$, then their skill would be removed. Otherwise, if it came before $last$, then we need to check which job they took. If they took the job $last$ wanted, then when they are removed, $last$ would take the job. Be careful about the case when N=0 or M=0.
